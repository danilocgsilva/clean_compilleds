# clean_compilleds

Automatically removes files generated for compilations

## Installing

1. Navigate to the root project folder form this project.
2. Executes:
```
pip install .
```

## Running

The installation creates a command called `cleancompileds`.

Navigates to your project's code and run the `cleancompileds`.

Right now, the project is ready just to clean compiled files from node and php projects.

## It's worth mention what happens behinds the curtain

The script makes a list from stuffs inside the current directory navigation. We know that the `vendor` folder is produced by php compiling, and `node_modules` is generated by node project installation, but is used just to compile the javascript in a web project, so must not go when storing the project for development porpouses. When finds the vendor module, we know that it is a php project, and if the node_modules is found, we know that is a node project **(FOR WEB FRONTEND ASSETS COMPILING)**. Both of them usually takes much space in the disk (usually are the biggest ones) and is easily rebuildable (in truth, is recommendable to recompile everything everytime that we change our environment for developing, stagging, production, whatever).
